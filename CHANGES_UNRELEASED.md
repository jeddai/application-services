## Error-support
### What's New
  - Added a new error reporting system that is intended to eventually replace using `log::error` to report errors
  - Added code using the new system to track down application-services#4856
  - Added UniFFI API for this crate.  Consumers should use this to register for error reports and breadcrumbs.

## FxA Client
### What's changed
- The devices retrieved from the devices list are now only the devices that have been accessed in 21 days. This should help remove duplicates and idle devices for users.
